# TODO - Tab Payment Orchestration Platform

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY FOR TOMORROW - USER SIGNUP ISSUE 🚨

### CRITICAL BUG: Organization Creation Not Working After Email Confirmation

**Problem**: Users complete registration → confirm email → get "Critical: User has no organization" error when accessing dashboard

**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKING USER ONBOARDING

**Investigation Results**:
- ✅ Database trigger `handle_new_user()` works in isolation tests
- ✅ Regular signup creates organizations correctly in test scripts  
- ✅ Email confirmation flow works
- ❌ **Real user flow fails** - confirmed users have no organizations

**Next Steps for Tomorrow**:

1. **Debug Real User Flow** 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - Use `/debug-user` page to inspect actual user data after signup/confirmation
   - Compare test vs real signup metadata and trigger execution
   - Check if trigger fires during actual registration vs test scenarios

2. **Fix Root Cause** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Identify why trigger works in tests but not real signup
   - Could be timing issue, metadata format, or trigger conditions
   - Ensure businessName metadata is properly passed to trigger

3. **Add Fallback Safety Net** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
   - Dashboard should handle missing organization gracefully
   - Auto-create organization if missing (fallback mechanism)
   - Better error handling and user guidance

4. **Test Complete Flow** 🔴 VALIDATION
   - Fresh signup → email confirmation → dashboard access
   - Verify organization creation works end-to-end
   - Confirm no duplicate business name requests

**Files to Focus On**:
- `/app/debug-user/page.tsx` - Debug current user state
- `/supabase/migrations/20250123_fix_organization_creation_trigger.sql` - Trigger logic
- `/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Registration metadata
- `/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Organization query and error handling

## STRATEGIC PIVOT: Multi-Processor Orchestration Platform 🎯

**Vision**: Build the payment orchestration layer that billion-dollar processors can't - enabling businesses to optimize payment routing across multiple processors with intelligent failover, cost optimization, and unified reporting.

**Target Market**: Mid-market businesses ($50M-$1B revenue) that have outgrown single-processor solutions but can't afford enterprise orchestration platforms.

**Core Value Proposition**:

- Save 5-10% on processing costs through intelligent routing
- Increase authorization rates by 10-15% with automatic failover
- Unified dashboard for all payment processors
- Zero vendor lock-in

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Console Statement Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

### Console Statement Removal - Clean up all console.log/error/warn statements (69 total) ✅

- [x] **Clean up Stripe webhook console.logs** (7 occurrences in `/app/api/v1/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
  - ✅ Replaced with logger service calls
  - ✅ Lines: 29, 35, 56, 83, 94, 110, 240

- [x] **Replace console.errors in authentication flows** with toast notifications
  - ✅ Accept invitation page - added toast notifications
  - ✅ Created auth layout with ToastProvider
  - ✅ All auth errors now show user-friendly messages

- [x] **Replace console.errors in API routes** with proper error responses
  - ✅ All API routes now use logger.error with proper context
  - ✅ Consistent error response format maintained
  - ✅ Better debugging with structured logging

- [x] **Replace console.errors in dashboard components** with toast notifications
  - ✅ Team management - shows success/error toasts
  - ✅ Processor settings - clipboard and error notifications
  - ✅ Tabs list - loading and copy notifications
  - ✅ Webhook status - error notifications

- [x] **Clean up console.warns** (4 occurrences)
  - ✅ API middleware - now uses logger.warn for deprecations
  - ✅ Invoice service - uses logger.warn with context

- [x] **Remove console statements from services**
  - ✅ Invitation service - replaced with logger.debug
  - ✅ All service layer console statements updated

**Note**: The logger service (`/lib/logger/index.ts`) has legitimate console statements as part of its implementation - these remain unchanged.

## Legacy High Priority Items (Evaluate for Orchestration Platform) 🔴

### Professional Invoicing System ✅ COMPLETED

#### Architecture Overview

The new invoicing system separates the concept of **tabs** (quotes/orders) from **invoices** (payment requests). This allows merchants to:

- Create multiple invoices from a single tab
- Invoice for specific items or amounts
- Split bills intelligently for restaurants, hotels, and professional services
- Track payments at the line-item level
- Maintain immutable audit trails

**Key Principle**: Tabs collect items, Invoices request payment for specific items/amounts.

- [x] **Core Invoice Architecture**
  - ✅ Separate invoices from tabs (tabs are quotes, invoices are payment requests)
  - ✅ Immutable invoice records with versioning system
  - ✅ Invoice-to-payment relationship tracking (multiple payments per invoice)
  - ✅ Real-time balance calculation at invoice and line-item level
  - ✅ Audit trail for all invoice state changes

- [x] **Database Schema Updates** ✅ COMPLETED

  ```sql
  -- Enhanced invoice structure
  invoices: {
    id, merchant_id, customer_id, tab_id,
    invoice_number (sequential, unique per merchant),
    status (draft, open, paid, void, uncollectible),
    issue_date, due_date,
    subtotal, tax_amount, total_amount,
    paid_amount, balance,
    payment_terms, notes,
    metadata
  }
  
  -- Invoice line items with payment tracking
  invoice_line_items: {
    id, invoice_id, 
    description, quantity, unit_price,
    line_amount, tax_amount, total_amount,
    allocated_amount, remaining_amount,
    group_id (for grouping items),
    source_line_item_id (from original tab),
    metadata
  }
  
  -- Payment allocation tracking
  invoice_payments: {
    id, invoice_id, payment_id,
    amount, applied_at,
    allocation_method (fifo, proportional, specific),
    line_item_allocations (JSONB)
  }
  
  -- Balance history for audit trail
  balance_history: {
    id, entity_type, entity_id,

export class KMSEncryptionService {
  static async getDataKey(merchantId: string): Promise<Buffer> {
    const command = new DecryptCommand({
      CiphertextBlob: Buffer.from(process.env.ENCRYPTED_DATA_KEY!, 'base64'),
      EncryptionContext: {
        merchantId,
        purpose: 'payment-credentials'
      }
    })

    const response = await kms.send(command)
    return Buffer.from(response.Plaintext!)
  }
}
```

6. **Integration with IAM** - Role-based access management

##### Implementation Priority Roadmap

1. **Current**: Environment variable (✅ Good for MVP/testing)
2. **Next**: AWS KMS integration (🎯 Production-ready for enterprise)
3. **Enterprise**: HSM for ultimate security (🔒 Maximum compliance)

##### When to Upgrade

- **Upgrade to HSM**: Financial services, government, ultra-high security requirements

**Security Assessment**: Current implementation is already production-ready for most SaaS companies. The professional key management upgrade is the logical next step for enterprise customers with strict compliance requirements.

#### Security Testing & Compliance

- ✅ **Comprehensive Security Test Suite**: 9 security tests covering:
  - Encryption/decryption validation
  - Key format validation  
  - Tampering detection (authenticated encryption)
  - Never expose credentials in errors
  - Secure random generation
- ✅ **PCI DSS Alignment**: Following requirements 3, 8, 10
- ✅ **GDPR Compliance**: Right to erasure, access logging

#### Implementation Files
