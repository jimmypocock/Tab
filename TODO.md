# TODO - Tab Payment Orchestration Platform

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY FOR TOMORROW - USER SIGNUP ISSUE üö®

### CRITICAL BUG: Organization Creation Not Working After Email Confirmation

**Problem**: Users complete registration ‚Üí confirm email ‚Üí get "Critical: User has no organization" error when accessing dashboard

**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKING USER ONBOARDING

**Investigation Results**:
- ‚úÖ Database trigger `handle_new_user()` works in isolation tests
- ‚úÖ Regular signup creates organizations correctly in test scripts  
- ‚úÖ Email confirmation flow works
- ‚ùå **Real user flow fails** - confirmed users have no organizations

**Next Steps for Tomorrow**:

1. **Debug Real User Flow** üî¥ HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - Use `/debug-user` page to inspect actual user data after signup/confirmation
   - Compare test vs real signup metadata and trigger execution
   - Check if trigger fires during actual registration vs test scenarios

2. **Fix Root Cause** üî¥ CRITICAL
   - Identify why trigger works in tests but not real signup
   - Could be timing issue, metadata format, or trigger conditions
   - Ensure businessName metadata is properly passed to trigger

3. **Add Fallback Safety Net** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
   - Dashboard should handle missing organization gracefully
   - Auto-create organization if missing (fallback mechanism)
   - Better error handling and user guidance

4. **Test Complete Flow** üî¥ VALIDATION
   - Fresh signup ‚Üí email confirmation ‚Üí dashboard access
   - Verify organization creation works end-to-end
   - Confirm no duplicate business name requests

**Files to Focus On**:
- `/app/debug-user/page.tsx` - Debug current user state
- `/supabase/migrations/20250123_fix_organization_creation_trigger.sql` - Trigger logic
- `/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Registration metadata
- `/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Organization query and error handling

## STRATEGIC PIVOT: Multi-Processor Orchestration Platform üéØ

**Vision**: Build the payment orchestration layer that billion-dollar processors can't - enabling businesses to optimize payment routing across multiple processors with intelligent failover, cost optimization, and unified reporting.

**Target Market**: Mid-market businesses ($50M-$1B revenue) that have outgrown single-processor solutions but can't afford enterprise orchestration platforms.

**Core Value Proposition**:

- Save 5-10% on processing costs through intelligent routing
- Increase authorization rates by 10-15% with automatic failover
- Unified dashboard for all payment processors
- Zero vendor lock-in

  - ‚úÖ Replaced with logger service calls
  - ‚úÖ Lines: 29, 35, 56, 83, 94, 110, 240

- [x] **Replace console.errors in authentication flows** with toast notifications
  - ‚úÖ Accept invitation page - added toast notifications
  - ‚úÖ Created auth layout with ToastProvider
  - ‚úÖ All auth errors now show user-friendly messages

- [x] **Replace console.errors in API routes** with proper error responses
  - ‚úÖ All API routes now use logger.error with proper context
  - ‚úÖ Consistent error response format maintained
  - ‚úÖ Better debugging with structured logging

- [x] **Replace console.errors in dashboard components** with toast notifications
  - ‚úÖ Team management - shows success/error toasts
  - ‚úÖ Processor settings - clipboard and error notifications
  - ‚úÖ Tabs list - loading and copy notifications
  - ‚úÖ Webhook status - error notifications

- [x] **Clean up console.warns** (4 occurrences)
  - ‚úÖ API middleware - now uses logger.warn for deprecations
  - ‚úÖ Invoice service - uses logger.warn with context

- [x] **Remove console statements from services**
  - ‚úÖ Invitation service - replaced with logger.debug
  - ‚úÖ All service layer console statements updated

**Note**: The logger service (`/lib/logger/index.ts`) has legitimate console statements as part of its implementation - these remain unchanged.

## Legacy High Priority Items (Evaluate for Orchestration Platform) üî¥

### Professional Invoicing System ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Architecture Overview

The new invoicing system separates the concept of **tabs** (quotes/orders) from **invoices** (payment requests). This allows merchants to:

- Create multiple invoices from a single tab
- Invoice for specific items or amounts
- Split bills intelligently for restaurants, hotels, and professional services
- Track payments at the line-item level
- Maintain immutable audit trails

**Key Principle**: Tabs collect items, Invoices request payment for specific items/amounts.

  - ‚úÖ Immutable invoice records with versioning system
  - ‚úÖ Invoice-to-payment relationship tracking (multiple payments per invoice)
  - ‚úÖ Real-time balance calculation at invoice and line-item level
  - ‚úÖ Audit trail for all invoice state changes

    issue_date, due_date,
    subtotal, tax_amount, total_amount,
    paid_amount, balance,
    payment_terms, notes,
    metadata
  }
  
  -- Invoice line items with payment tracking
  invoice_line_items: {
    id, invoice_id, 
    description, quantity, unit_price,
    line_amount, tax_amount, total_amount,
    allocated_amount, remaining_amount,
    group_id (for grouping items),
    source_line_item_id (from original tab),
    metadata
  }
  
  -- Payment allocation tracking
  invoice_payments: {
    id, invoice_id, payment_id,
    amount, applied_at,
    allocation_method (fifo, proportional, specific),
    line_item_allocations (JSONB)
  }
  
  -- Balance history for audit trail
  balance_history: {
    id, entity_type, entity_id,
    previous_balance, new_balance,

    transaction_id, created_at
  }

**Next Level**: Professional key management services for enterprise compliance

##### AWS KMS (Key Management Service) - Most Popular ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

```typescript
// Implementation example for future upgrade:
import { KMSClient, DecryptCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-kms'

const kms = new KMSClient({ region: 'us-east-1' })

export class KMSEncryptionService {
  static async getDataKey(merchantId: string): Promise<Buffer> {
    const command = new DecryptCommand({
