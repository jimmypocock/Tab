# Endpoint Testing Summary

## Current State

After analyzing the codebase and attempting to create comprehensive tests, here are the findings:

### Test Infrastructure Issues

1. **Database Mocking Complexity**: The codebase uses Drizzle ORM with its relational query API (`db.query.table.findMany`), which is difficult to mock properly due to:
   - Complex query builder patterns
   - Nested relational queries with `with` clauses
   - Dynamic ordering and filtering
   - Transaction support

2. **Circular Dependencies**: Tests need to mock modules before importing them, but the mock objects need to be defined before jest.mock(), creating initialization issues.

3. **Existing Test Failures**: Currently 79 tests are failing (91.9% pass rate) due to:
   - Incorrect mocking patterns
   - Mismatched query builder expectations
   - Missing mock implementations

### Working Test Examples

The existing tests in `__tests__/api/tabs.test.ts` show a working pattern:
- They mock the database at a higher level
- They use test data factories
- They handle authentication mocking properly

### Recommended Approach

1. **Use Integration Tests**: Instead of mocking the database, use a real test database
   - Faster and more reliable
   - Tests actual SQL queries
   - Catches real issues

2. **Fix Existing Tests First**: Before adding new tests, fix the 79 failing tests
   - Update mocking patterns
   - Ensure consistent mock structure
   - Remove duplicate test logic

3. **Test Categories**:
   - **Unit Tests**: For pure functions and utilities
   - **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints with real database
   - **E2E Tests**: For complete user flows

### Completed Work

1. **Created Test Helpers**:
   - `api-test-helpers.ts`: Request creation and response validation
   - `db-mock.ts`: Database mocking utilities
   - Test data factories

2. **Documented Test Strategy**:
   - Comprehensive endpoint list
   - Test categories for each endpoint
   - Success metrics

3. **Created Example Tests**:
   - Tab endpoints comprehensive test
   - Line item endpoints comprehensive test
   - Simple tab test demonstrating patterns

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Mocking**:
   ```typescript
   // Create a centralized mock that matches Drizzle's API
   const createDrizzleMock = () => ({
     query: {
       tabs: {
         findMany: jest.fn(),
         findFirst: jest.fn()
       }
     },
     select: jest.fn(),
     insert: jest.fn(),
     // ... etc
   })
   ```

2. **Update All Tests**: Update existing tests to use consistent mocking

3. **Run Test Suite**: Fix all 79 failing tests

4. **Add New Tests**: Only after existing tests pass

### Critical Endpoints to Test

Priority endpoints that handle money and security:

1. **Payment Processing**:
   - POST /api/v1/public/checkout-session
   - POST /api/v1/webhooks/stripe
   - POST /api/v1/public/invoice-payment

2. **API Key Management**:
   - POST /api/v1/organizations/[id]/api-keys
   - DELETE /api/v1/organizations/[id]/api-keys/[keyId]

3. **Tab Operations**:
   - POST /api/v1/tabs (create with line items)
   - POST /api/v1/tabs/[id]/void
   - DELETE /api/v1/tabs/[id]

4. **Invoice Operations**:
   - POST /api/v1/billing-groups/[id]/invoice
   - POST /api/v1/invoices/[id]/send

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Test Coverage**: 90%+ for utilities and services
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 100% for all API endpoints
- **E2E Test Coverage**: Critical user flows (payment, onboarding)

### Conclusion

The endpoint testing infrastructure exists but needs fixing. The main blocker is the database mocking pattern. Once fixed, comprehensive endpoint testing can be implemented following the patterns established in the existing working tests.
